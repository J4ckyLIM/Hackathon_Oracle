## Tech

For our project we are using dif technology:
  - IPFS(InterPlanetary Files System)
  - IPNS (InterPlanetary Name System)
  - TheGraph(GRT)
  - GraphQl
  - TypeScript & Node
  - Solidity


## IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.
Also, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.

## IPNS (InterPlanetary Name System)

InterPlanetary Name System is an IPFS address dynamic, so it's creating an address that can be updated.
A name in IPNS is the hash of a public key. It is associated with a record containing information about the hash it links to that is signed by the corresponding private key. New records can be signed and published at any time.


## Explanation

Our first thought was to think about how to make the data onchain/offchain easily. For this we thought of this response scheme:
- Possibility to add a "human api" like the company.

The different steps are:
1. Get the data coming from 2 differents standard APIs (Polygon "https://polygon.io/" & Financial Modeling Prep "https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/").
   Compare the Data and get :
 
 ```sh
 {
  "afterHours": 322.1,
  "close": 325.12,
  "from": "2020-10-14T00:00:00.000Z",
  "high": 326.2,
  "low": 322.3,
  "open": 324.66,
  "preMarket": 324.5,
  "status": "OK",
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "volume": 26122646
 }.
 ```
 
2. Data processing to validate data veracity.
3. Create & push data to IPFS node (get json file). -> From this step the data are stored On-chain.
4. Create new CID from IPFS data and update the IPNS Gateway (Dynamic url using CID).
5. Set IPNS hash to our oracle contract.
6. Storage of the IPNS gateway on a decentralized oracle (smart contract).
7. Certify data through CAST framework. (In progress).

## In progress

- Adding our CIDs to a history file. Add our CIDs in a history file to keep track of all the API requests made during the day.
- UI Explorer to search for a specific daily candle.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org).

```sh
$ yarn install
```

## Usage

```sh
$ yarn start-dev
```

## Execution

Once the project is launched, it will first fetch the data via an API, check that the data is not erroneous. Once validated, this data is stored in a decentralized cloud which is directly linked to a smart contract.
