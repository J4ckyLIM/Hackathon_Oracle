## Explanation

Our first thought was to think about how to make the data onchain/offchain easily. For this we thought of this response scheme:

The different steps are:
1. Get the data coming from different standard APIs.
 (ex: {
  "afterHours": 322.1,
  "close": 325.12,
  "from": "2020-10-14T00:00:00.000Z",
  "high": 326.2,
  "low": 322.3,
  "open": 324.66,
  "preMarket": 324.5,
  "status": "OK",
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "volume": 26122646
 }).
 
2. Data processing.
3. Data storage on a decentralized cloud here IPFS.
4. Storage of the IPNS gateway on a decentralized oracle (smart contract)

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org).

```sh
$ yarn install
```

## Usage

```sh
$ yarn start
```

## Execution

Once the project is launched, it will first fetch the data via an API, check that the data is not erroneous. Once validated, this data is stored in a decentralized cloud which is directly linked to a smart contract.
